# These blue-ish Japanese traffic lights

While we watched yet another episode of [Spy x Family](https://trakt.tv/shows/spy-x-family) this week, my son, who's been studying Japanese on his own for some time now, told me something about the Japanese traffic lights and how instead of using the green color to mean "go", they sometimes use the blue color.

That got me intrigued. My son's learned a lot regarding the Japanese culture and everything, but that seemed somewhat strange — *but could it be true*?

## TLDR: Yes, that's true.

I went after [a couple](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/japan-green-traffic-lights-blue) [of articles](https://www.rd.com/article/heres-japan-blue-traffic-lights)on the subject and, to my complete surprise — and delight, Japanese traffic lights **do have** blue in its color: at least, the bluest possible tint... of **green**.

A long time ago, hundreds of years, actually, Japanese language only had words to describe four basic colors: black (黒 *kuro*), white (白 *shiro*), red (赤 *aka*), and blue (青 *ao*). And in that time, anyone wanting to describe something green would need to use the word for blue — 青 *ao*, and, according to what I read, it all went well for the first thousand years. After that, the word 緑 *midori* started to be written to describe the green color. But even then, and this is important, 緑 *midori* was considered a shade of 青 *ao*.

There are a lot of interesting facts regarding the use of the word for blue in Japanese to actually describe green things, that you can check for yourself in the above linked articles.

The thing is, the first Japanese traffic lights had green as a color for *go*, as much as the rest of the world — but the official government traffic legislation docs kept referring to green traffic lights as 青 *ao* rather than 緑 *midori*, despite of all international traffic law decrees.

And here's the thing, the explanation that *justifies* the blue color in Japanese traffic lights: Japan's government suffered a big international pressure to comply with the world standards, until, in 1973, it mandated through a cabinet order that traffic lights use **the bluest shade of green possible**.

And this is what ended up allowing the color to be still considered technically *green*, but noticeably **blue enough** to justify the continued use of the 青 *ao* nomenclature in the national documentation.

So, it's all a matter of cultural resistance: although modern Japanese  perfectly allows anyone to distinguish between blue and green, the ancient Japanese language concept from more than a 1,000 years ago which considers *green* to be but a shade of *blue* is firmly rooted in that country's culture. Quite impressive, really.
