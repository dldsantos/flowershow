### Luca Lampariello's 6 rules for remembering words in any language


âœ± You need native, original content in your target language, a notebook and material to write on it.

1. Mark, highlight or underline what you want to remember
2. Transfer the most important expressions into your notebook
3. Store just enough expressions to remember the gist of the content
4. Connect stored expressions to the context in which they were learned
5. Translate the expressions into your native language
6. Review your notebook regularly
