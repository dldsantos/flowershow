Encontrei [este post](https://carfree.city/@sanae/110001693816877702) do usuário Sanae no Mastodon e achei muito interessante a *teoria* de que LLMs como o ChatGPT não refletem como a maioria das pessoas pensam, raciocinam ou escrevem — **mas refletem** como os Venture Capitalists fazem essas coisas. Muito bom.

>However, they do reflect how VCs tend to think, reason and write: they don't actually understand what they are saying or what they are doing, and their abilities are largely an illusion based on a mix of having a staggering number of resources at their disposal, and also on vacuuming up other people's work and claiming it as their own.

Not every hobby needs to be a project. Not everything needs to be a whole *thing* with a goal and an endpoint. It's okay to not finish something. It's okay to pick up something for a bit, explore it, start making something, and then drop it without making any "progress". 

Productivity is capitalist bullshit that doesn't need to infect your free time too. Have some fun
