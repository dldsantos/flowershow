### Write without Fear, Edit without Mercy

1. **Write something instead of nothing.** Maybe you’ll change it later, but it’s a start.
2. **Write when you’re inspired.** That might mean making time to get inspired.
3. **Don’t set goals about the number of words.** Write only as much as you need to, as opposed to a 500-word essay.
4. **Don’t get stuck choosing words.** Pick one and move on.
5. **Spend twice as much time editing as you do writing.**
6. **Have a time gap** between when you write and when you edit. You’ll have fresh eyes a day later.
7. **Get someone else to proof.** Next best option is to proof by reading out loud.
8. If you’re not a great writer, **get a good editor**.
