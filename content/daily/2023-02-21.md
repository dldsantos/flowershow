More than merely exchanging information is required for effective communication. It's all about deciphering the emotion and motivations underlying the data. You must be able to clearly communicate a message as well as listen in such a way that you grasp the entire meaning of what is being said and make the other person feel heard and understood.

Effective communication appears to be a natural instinct. But, all too frequently, something goes wrong when we try to communicate with others. We say one thing, but the other person hears something completely different, resulting in misunderstandings, dissatisfaction, and conflict.

This can cause issues in your relationships at home, school, and at work.

how are you doing tonight dr peterson

incredible pretty good questions a little on the brutal side i might say but i'm incredibly nervous to uh talk in front of you because you've got to be one of the most formidable people that i've ever heard of or ever listened to or ever seen 

so my question is again you're one of the best communicators that i've ever listened to...  if i could be half as good as you or at communicating as you are i would be set... how can i teach myself to do that?

practice... you know really like, well there's a couple of things...  ==it helps to read, a lot... it really helps to write...  so if you want to make yourself articulate, which is a very good idea, then, not only should you read but you should write down what you think and, if you can do that a little bit, every day, 15 minutes — maybe you could steal 15 minutes and do it every day —, but if you do that for 10 years, you really straighten out your thinking.==

if you're going to speak effectively you have to know way more than you're talking about, you know, so if you, this is often difficult for beginning lectures at university because they'll do a lecture on a topic, but they only know as much as they're saying in the lecture, and they get kind of stuck to their notes because of it, but, ==you want to know 10 times as much as you are saying in the lecture and then you can specify a stepping path through it and elaborate with the other things that you know, but to do that you have to do a lot of reading... ==

but ==you also have to do a lot of reading because that's where the synthesize, that's where the synthesizing comes, so that's on the "input" side== and then, on the "output" side, well there's some tricks... techniques, let's say, is like if you're speaking in front of a group... 

==you are not delivering a talk to a group, that's not what you're doing — the talk isn't a package thing that you present to a group, there isn't a group, there's a bunch of individuals and you talk to them... so when i talk to a group i always talk to people one at a time and that makes it easier, too, because you know how to talk to a person...== it's like can you talk to a thousand people? well probably not, because it's too intimidating, but there isn't a thousand people there... there's a thousand individuals and so you just look at an individual and you say something... ==and you can tell if they're engaged: they look confused, or they look interested, or they look angry, or they look bored or maybe, they're asleep (in which case you look at someone else)...==

and they give you feedback about how you're doing and so one thing is to to have something to say, yeah, but ==the next thing is pay attention to who you're talking to== because unless you're very badly socialized and that seems unlikely in your case because you know, you present yourself at least moderately well, you know... and... well, i mean i don't know you very well but at first, but on first sight, you know, you're doing fine... so ==the probability that if you pay attention to the individuals that you're talking to, that your natural wealth of social skill will manifest itself is extremely high...  and so you don't deliver a talk to an audience, that's a really bad way of thinking about it. you're actually engaged in a conversation with an audience: even if they're not talking l, they're nodding m, and shifting position and, you know, looking like this, and you can you can pull that in, and use it to govern the level at which you're addressing the entire audience...==

so the last thing i would say is, well, ==having the aim to be a good communicator is a good start==, and you think, well i could buttress that to some degree... there isn't anything that you can possibly, this is the whole point of a liberal education, ==there isn't anything that you can possibly do that makes you more competent in everything you do than to learn how to communicate — i don't care if you're going to be a carpenter, i mean, being a carpenter by the way is very difficult,  especially if you're a good carpenter... but if you're good at communicating as a carpenter you're like 10 times better as a carpenter==

so, and this is something that the liberal arts colleges, i think, i don't know if they've forgotten it but, they don't do a very good job of marketing... it's like what's the use of a bachelor's degree in Bachelor of Arts? 

it's like, well, ==you can think , you can write, you can speak, you've read something... it's like, the economic value of that is incalculable... the people that i've watched in my life who've been spectacularly successful are...  they have skills... clearly that's a minimum precondition, but they're also very, very good at articulating themselves...==

and so, whenever they negotiate they're successful... well ==that's kind of like the definition of success in life, right? you negotiate, and you're successfull... it doesn't mean you win, because if you're a good negotiator, if you're a really good negotiator, everybody walks away from the negotiation thrilled — and so, then people line up to do things with you... so,  and that's all dependent on your ability to communicate... so, practice.==

thank you very much
